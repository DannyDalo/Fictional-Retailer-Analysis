# <ins>**Sales Analysis and Performance for Fictional Retail Company**</ins>


## **<ins>Project Summary</ins>**
We will be taking a look at the datasets we have and using it to get information about our fictional company, TechSphere. Through analysis of the information, we will find out more about the company, as well as its performance from 2016-2021. We will come up with useful recommendations to improve business strategies and take steps to solving existing problems.

The main objectives of this project is to provide insights into sales performance, customer behavior, product performance, and store efficiency to inform strategic business decisions.
